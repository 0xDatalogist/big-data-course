    "Functional programming is the basis of most modern Big Data processing systems.\n",
    "Before going forward to the course, it is important to master data processing\n",
    "techniques using a functional programming style. In this assignment, your task \n",
    "is to train yourselves in thinking in a functional way when processing data. \n",
    "\n",
    "Many of the the tasks below are easy, but some are not and require many\n",
    "iterations (and extensive testing!) to get right. For some of them, you\n",
    "can find ready-made solutions on the internet. Even though it may be tempting,\n",
    "I advise you against copying and pasting them here, as you will regret it\n",
    "later on in the course.\n",

    "This assignment has a total of *115* points. Your grade is calculated with `min(points/10, 10)`, i.e. you only need 100 points for a 10. A few notes:\n",
    "\n",
    "* For each function you define, you also need to define at least one working example.\n",
    "* Do not change the given function signatures.\n",
